operators:
  - id: "diff"
    symbol: "diff"
    full_name: "Differentiation Operator"
    
    definition: |
      The fundamental operation that produces distinctions from a continuous,
      processual substrate. Ontologically primary and cannot be reduced to
      more basic operations.
      
      diff is the generative aspect of the prohibition: it creates the distinctions
      that prevent absolute identity.
    
    signature: "diff: Process → Distinction"
    
    ontological_status: "primitive"
    
    derived_from: "CORE/axioms.yaml#axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity"
    
    relationship_to_CMI: |
      diff is the operational expression of Momentum (Moment-Impulse):
      - Prohibition generates momentum
      - Momentum manifests as perpetual diff operations
      - diff produces the distinctions that constitute motion
    
    applicable_to:
      - category: "monos"
        category_ref: "CORE/ontology.yaml#categories/monos"
        status: "fundamental"
        notes: |
          In Monos, diff is the only ontologically primitive operation.
          Reality exists as perpetual differentiation.
      
      - category: "logos"
        category_ref: "CORE/ontology.yaml#categories/logos"
        status: "modeled"
        notes: |
          In Logos, diff can be represented and modeled, but is always
          a fixation (approximation) of the Monos-level process.
    
    properties:
      - property: "Non-reversibility"
        description: "diff cannot be 'undone' to restore absolute identity"
        
      - property: "Continuity"
        description: "Operates on processual, non-discrete substrate"

    related_operators:
      - "dissipate"
      - "fix"
    
    notes: |
      diff is not a function in the classical mathematical sense
      (deterministic input → output). It represents the ontological fact
      that reality is inherently and perpetually differentiating.
      
      The prohibition of absolute identity (axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity)
      necessitates diff as the fundamental ontological operation.

  - id: "dissipate"
    symbol: "dissipate"
    short_symbol: "diss"
    full_name: "Dissipation Operator"
    aliases: ["dissipate", "diss"]
    
    definition: |
      The operation that prevents fixation in Monos by continuously dispersing
      any emergent stability. Dissipation is the energetic aspect of the prohibition:
      energy must be expended to maintain momentum and prevent 'freezing' into identity.
      
      dissipate is the enforcement mechanism: it actively destroys any tendency
      toward stasis, ensuring compliance with the prohibition.
    
    signature: "diss: Process → Energy_Dispersal (with ΔS > 0)"
    
    ontological_status: "enforcing"
    
    derived_from: "CORE/axioms.yaml#axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity"
    
    relationship_to_CMI: |
      dissipate is the energetic consequence of the CMI structure:
      
      1. Prohibition (Conflict) → generates conserved momentum
      2. Momentum (Moment-Impulse) → requires force to maintain (F = dp/dt)
      3. Force → requires energy expenditure (W = ∫F·dx)
      4. Energy expenditure → manifests as dissipation
      
      Therefore: Dissipation is the "cost" of enforcing the prohibition.
      It is not optional but ontologically necessary.
    
    applicable_to:
      - category: "monos"
        category_ref: "CORE/ontology.yaml#categories/monos"
        status: "necessary"
        notes: |
          In Monos, dissipation actively operates to prevent any emergent fixation.
          Without dissipation, the prohibition would be violated.
      
      - category: "logos"
        category_ref: "CORE/ontology.yaml#categories/logos"
        status: "modeled_but_not_active"
        notes: |
          In Logos, dissipation can be modeled (e.g., friction, heat loss),
          but is not ontologically active. Models can idealize 'closed systems'
          where dissipation is negligible.
    
    properties:
      - property: "Irreversibility"
        description: "dissipation cannot be reversed; entropy always increases"
        
      - property: "Universality"
        description: "Operates on all processes in Monos without exception"
        
      - property: "Energy-dispersing"
        description: "Converts organized energy into dispersed forms (heat, entropy)"
    
    physical_correspondence:
      ontology: "Dissipation (prevention of fixation)"
      physics: "Energy expenditure and entropy increase"
      mechanism: |
        The prohibition generates momentum (p conserved).
        Momentum requires force to maintain (F = dp/dt).
        Force requires energy (E = ∫F·dx).
        Energy disperses as dissipation (ΔS > 0).
    
    formal_constraints:
      - "dissipate operates only in Monos"
      - "∀ p ∈ Monos: dissipate(p) → ΔS(p) > 0 (entropy always increases)"
      - "dissipate is irreversible (time-asymmetric): no dissipate⁻¹ exists"
      - "In Logos, dissipation is modeled but not ontologically enforced"
    
    physical_manifestations:
      - domain: "thermodynamics"
        instance: "Entropy increase (Second Law: ΔS ≥ 0)"
        explanation: |
          The Second Law is not a separate physical law but a consequence
          of ontological dissipation. Energy dispersal is necessary to
          enforce the prohibition.
        
      - domain: "quantum_mechanics"
        instance: "Decoherence (collapse of superposition)"
        explanation: |
          Quantum dissipation prevents fixation of superposed states.
          Decoherence is the quantum manifestation of the prohibition's enforcement.
        
      - domain: "cosmology"
        instance: "Expansion and cooling of universe"
        explanation: |
          Cosmic dissipation (expansion, cooling, dilution) ensures the universe
          cannot 'freeze' into a static state.
        
      - domain: "time"
        instance: "Arrow of time (temporal irreversibility)"
        explanation: |
          The arrow of time results from irreversible dissipation. Time's
          directionality is the signature of the prohibition's enforcement.
    
    examples:
      - domain: "mechanics"
        instance: "Friction (kinetic energy → heat)"
        
      - domain: "electromagnetism"
        instance: "Radiation (energy dispersal as photons)"
        
      - domain: "biology"
        instance: "Metabolic heat production (chemical energy → heat)"
    
    usage_examples:
      - notation: "diss(p)"
        meaning: "Dissipation of process p"
        
      - notation: "diss(x) → ΔS(x) > 0"
        meaning: "Dissipation of x increases its entropy"
    
    related_operators:
      - "diff"
      - "fix"
    
    relationship_to_diff: |
      diff and dissipate are complementary:
      - diff produces distinctions (generative)
      - dissipate prevents their fixation (dissipative)
      
      Together, they ensure perpetual process in Monos.
    
    notes: |
      Dissipation is not 'waste' but ontological necessity. It is the
      energy signature of the prohibition's active enforcement.
      
      Short form: diss (for brevity in formal expressions)
      
      The impossibility of perpetual motion machines, the increase of entropy,
      and the arrow of time all follow from ontological dissipation.
      
      Without dissipation, reality would 'freeze' into absolute identity,
      violating the foundational axiom.

  - id: "fix"
    symbol: "fix"
    full_name: "Fixation Operator"
    
    definition: |
      The operation that stabilizes distinctions (produced by diff) into discrete,
      identifiable, and repeatable entities. Enables modeling, prediction, and
      scientific formalization.
      
      fix is only possible in Logos (models), where the prohibition is suspended
      for epistemic purposes. In Monos, fix is ontologically impossible.
    
    signature: "fix: Distinction → Entity"
    
    ontological_status: "derivative"
    
    derived_from: 
      - "CORE/operators.yaml#diff"
      - "CORE/axioms.yaml#axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity"
    
    relationship_to_CMI: |
      fix is the epistemic complement to the ontological CMI structure:
      - In Monos: Prohibition enforces momentum; fix is impossible
      - In Logos: Prohibition is suspended; fix enables modeling
      
      fix allows us to create stable models despite ontological flux.
    
    applicable_to:
      - category: "logos"
        category_ref: "CORE/ontology.yaml#categories/logos"
        status: "fundamental"
        notes: |
          In Logos, fix is the foundational operation enabling models.
          All scientific theories depend on fix to create stable entities.
      
      - category: "monos"
        category_ref: "CORE/ontology.yaml#categories/monos"
        status: "ontologically_impossible"
        notes: |
          In Monos, fix cannot be instantiated. Any attempt to fix reality
          would violate the prohibition of absolute identity. Dissipation
          actively prevents fixation.
    
    properties:
      - property: "Selectivity"
        description: "fix selects specific aspects of diff for stabilization"
        
      - property: "Discretization"
        description: "Converts continuous distinctions into discrete entities"
        
      - property: "Repeatability"
        description: "Enables identity: fix(x) = x within a model"
    
    physical_correspondence:
      ontology: "Fixation (epistemic stabilization)"
      physics: "Conservation laws in idealized closed systems"
      notes: |
        In Logos, we model systems as 'closed' with conserved energy, momentum, etc.
        In Monos, no system is truly closed; dissipation always operates.
    
    formal_constraints:
      - "fix: Logos only (∄ fix in Monos)"
      - "fix ∘ diff ≠ identity (fixation is always selective, lossy)"
      - "∀ x ∈ Logos: fix(x) = x (operational stability)"
    
    examples:

        instance: "Particle as fix of quantum field excitations"

    related_operators:
      - "diff"
      - "dissipate"
    
    relationship_to_diff: |
      fix is ontologically posterior to diff:
      1. diff produces distinctions (Monos-level)
      2. fix stabilizes selected distinctions into entities (Logos-level)
      
      fix is an epistemic operation, not an ontological one.
      It represents our capacity to model reality, not reality itself.
    
    relationship_to_dissipate: |
      fix and dissipate are opposites but operate at different levels:
      - In Monos: dissipate prevents fixation (ontological enforcement)
      - In Logos: fix enables modeling (epistemic necessity)
      
      They do not conflict because they operate in different categories.
    
    notes: |
      The impossibility of fix in Monos is a direct consequence of the
      prohibition and dissipation. If fix were possible in Monos,
      absolute identity could be instantiated, violating the axiom.
      
      All scientific models operate through fix. The iterative refinement
      of science consists in discovering new distinctions (diff) that
      previous fixations failed to capture, and recognizing dissipative
      effects that models neglected.

  meta:
    principle: |
      Operator composition is constrained by the ontological impossibility
      of reversing differentiation (diff) once dissipation (diss) has occurred,
      and the prohibition of unfixing (fix) back into pure process.
      
      The composition rules derive from:
      1. The irreversibility of diff (no diff⁻¹)
      2. The irreversibility of diss (no diss⁻¹, entropy arrow)
      3. The categorical boundary between Monos and Logos

      semantics: "Differentiation followed by dissipation (natural flow)"
      domain: "Monos"
      irreversible: true
      explanation: |
        This is the minimal ontological process: distinctions emerge (diff)
        and are immediately dispersed (diss) to prevent fixation.
        This sequence constitutes the fundamental dynamic of Monos.

      irreversible: true
      explanation: |
        After dissipation has dispersed a process, the observer can apply
        fix to stabilize the outcome as a discrete entity in Logos.
        This is the onto-epistemic projection.

      domain: "Full onto-epistemic process"
      irreversible: true
      canonical: true
      explanation: |
        This is the canonical sequence for scientific fact generation:
        1. Reality differentiates (diff in Monos)
        2. Dissipation prevents fixation (diss in Monos)
        3. Observer fixes outcome as fact (fix in Logos)

      reason: "Cannot differentiate a fixed representation (violates Logos constraints)"
      violation: "Attempts to treat epistemic fixation as ontological process"
      explanation: |
        Once a state is fixed in Logos, it cannot undergo ontological
        differentiation. This would require Logos to generate Monos,
        which violates the onto-epistemic boundary.
        
        fix produces discrete entities; diff operates on continuous process.
        These categories are incompatible.
      
    - operator_chain: [fix, diss]
      reason: "Cannot dissipate a fixed state (already in Logos)"
      violation: "Confuses representation with process"
      explanation: |
        Dissipation operates only in Monos. A fixed entity in Logos
        is already removed from the domain where dissipation acts.
        
        Attempting fix → diss would require diss to operate in Logos,
        which is ontologically impossible.
      
    - operator_chain: [diss, diff]
      reason: "Cannot re-differentiate after dissipation (thermodynamic arrow)"
      violation: "Attempts to reverse entropy"
      explanation: |
        Dissipation enforces irreversibility. Once energy/information
        is dispersed, it cannot be re-concentrated to produce new
        distinctions from the same substrate.
        
        This would violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which
        is an ontological necessity in Metamonism, not an empirical
        regularity.

  consequence: |
    The sequence diff → diss is the minimal ontological process.
    The addition of fix creates the minimal onto-epistemic cycle.
    
    All other compositions either:
      (a) reduce to these patterns, or
      (b) violate the foundational axiom
