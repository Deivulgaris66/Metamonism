definitions:
  - term: "absolute_identity"
    definition: |
      A hypothetical state in which no distinctions exist whatsoever.
      Equivalent to complete indifference, total self-sameness, or absence of differentiation.
    
    status: "ontologically_impossible"
    
    reference: "CORE/axioms.yaml#axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity"
    
    notes: "Cannot be instantiated according to the Indifference Prohibition Axiom."

  - term: "distinction"
    definition: "A minimal differentiable feature or property of a process or entity."
    
    status: "ontologically_necessary"
    
    reference: "CORE/axioms.yaml#axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity"
    
    notes: "Every actual process must possess distinctions (axiom implication)."

  - term: "CMI"
    full_name: "Conflict-Moment-Impulse"
    russian_original: "КМИ (Конфликт-Момент-Импульс)"
    
    definition: |
      The foundational triadic structure of Metamonism:
      1. Prohibition (Conflict): ontological impossibility of absolute identity
      2. Momentum (Moment-Impulse): conserved necessity of differentiation
      3. Force: enforcement mechanism (F = dp/dt)
      
      This structure generates all physical laws and processes.
    
    status: "foundational_structure"
    
    reference: "CORE/ontology.yaml#principle_CMI_structure"
    
    historical_note: |
      Originally formulated in Russian as КМИ (Конфликт-Момент-Импульс),
      translated as CMI (Conflict-Moment-Impulse) in English.
      The term "Momentum" unifies both Moment (instant) and Impulse (thrust).
    
    notes: |
      CMI was the original framework formulation. It establishes
      Metamonism as a physical ontology, not just philosophical speculation.

  - term: "Momentum"
    definition: |
      The conserved necessity of differentiation, manifesting physically as
      momentum (p = mv). Represents the ontological impossibility of stasis:
      reality 'cannot stop' without violating the prohibition.
    
    ontological_status: "conserved_necessity"
    
    physical_manifestation: "p = mv (momentum)"
    
    relationship_to_CMI: |
      Momentum is the "M" and "I" of CMI:
      - Moment: instantiation of process in time
      - Impulse: conserved quantity of motion
      
      In physics, "momentum" unifies both concepts.
    
    reference: "CORE/axioms.yaml#axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity"
    
    notes: |
      Conservation of momentum (physical law) is the physical expression
      of the ontological prohibition. Just as momentum cannot vanish,
      the process of differentiation cannot cease.

  - term: "dissipation (diss)"
    definition: |
      The continuous dispersal of energy necessary to prevent fixation in Monos.
      Dissipation is the energy cost of enforcing the prohibition: it ensures
      reality cannot 'freeze' into absolute identity.
    
    short_form: "diss"
    
    ontological_status: "enforcement_mechanism"
    
    physical_manifestation: "Entropy increase (ΔS > 0)"
    
    relationship_to_CMI: |
      Dissipation is the energetic consequence of the CMI structure:
      - Prohibition generates momentum
      - Momentum requires force (F = dp/dt)
      - Force requires energy (E = ∫F·dx)
      - Energy expenditure manifests as dissipation
    
    full_specification: "CORE/operators.yaml#dissipate"
    
    usage: "diss(p) → ΔS(p) > 0"
    
    notes: |
      The Second Law of Thermodynamics (ΔS ≥ 0) is a consequence of
      ontological dissipation, not a separate physical law.

  - term: "Monos"
    definition: |
      The processual, continuous ontological substrate where distinctions occur.
      Reality as perpetual differentiation, where momentum is conserved and
      dissipation actively operates.
    
    status: "ontology"
    
    symbolic_representability: false
    
    full_specification: "CORE/ontology.yaml#categories/monos"
    
    notes: |
      See ontology.yaml for complete definition and characteristics.
      CRITICAL: Monos is non-symbolic; all symbols belong to Logos.

  - term: "Logos"
    definition: |
      The epistemic framework where distinctions are fixed and modeled.
      Space of theories and representations where fix operations are permitted.
    
    status: "epistemology"
    
    symbolic_representability: true

  - term: "diff"
    definition: "Fundamental operation of differentiation producing distinction."
    
    full_specification: "CORE/operators.yaml#diff"

  - term: "fix"
    definition: "Operation of fixation, stabilizing distinctions into discrete entities."
