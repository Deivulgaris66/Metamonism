# ================= CONSISTENCY TESTS =================

consistency_tests:
  - id: "test_monos_fixation_impossibility"
    question: "Can fix operation exist in Monos?"
    correct_answer: "No"
    
    reasoning: |
      fix(x) = x implies absolute identity (x remains unchanged).
      This violates axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity.
      Therefore, fix is ontologically impossible in Monos.
    
    validation: "If fix(x) exists in Monos → contradiction → framework violated"

      - "CORE/operators.yaml#fix"

  - id: "test_dissipation_necessity"
    question: "Can dissipation stop or reverse?"
    correct_answer: "No"
    
    reasoning: |
      Dissipation enforces the prohibition by preventing fixation.
      If dissipation stopped, fixation would become possible in Monos.
      This would violate the axiom.
      Therefore, ΔS > 0 always (irreversible).
    
    validation: "If ΔS ≤ 0 persistently → prohibition violated → impossible"

  - id: "test_momentum_conservation"
    question: "Can momentum vanish in Monos?"
    correct_answer: "No"
    
    reasoning: |
      Momentum (p) is the physical expression of the prohibition.
      If p could vanish, motion would cease → identity possible.
      This violates the axiom.
      Therefore, p is conserved.
    
    validation: "If p → 0 → motion ceases → identity possible → impossible"

  - id: "test_logos_representation"
    question: "Can Logos models equal Monos reality?"
    correct_answer: "No"
    
    reasoning: |
      Logos uses fix operations to create stable entities.
      Monos forbids fix (perpetual differentiation).
      Therefore, Logos can only represent (approximate) Monos, never equal it.
    
    validation: "If Logos = Monos → fix exists in Monos → contradiction"

  - id: "test_absolute_zero_impossibility"
    question: "Can a system reach absolute zero (T = 0)?"
    correct_answer: "No (asymptotically approached but never reached)"
    
    reasoning: |
      T = 0 implies complete cessation of motion.
      This would violate the prohibition (motion is necessary).
      Therefore, absolute zero is unreachable (Third Law of Thermodynamics).
    
    validation: "If T → 0 → motion → 0 → identity possible → impossible"
    
    references:
      - "CORE/ontology.yaml#principle_motion_as_necessity"

  - id: "test_monos_non_symbolic"
    question: "Can Monos be directly represented in a formal system?"
    correct_answer: "No"
    
    reasoning: |
      Monos is continuous, processual, and non-discrete.
      Formal systems require symbols, which are discrete and fixed (Logos).
      Therefore, Monos cannot be directly represented, only approximated via Logos models.
    
    validation: "If Monos is symbolic → fix exists in Monos → contradiction"
    
    references:
      - "CORE/ontology.yaml#categories/monos"
    
    implications:
      - "All equations, models, and theories are Logos constructs"
      - "Mathematics describes models, not reality itself"
      - "AI attempting to 'model Monos directly' commits category error"

# ================= COMMON ERRORS =================

common_errors:
  - error: "Treating information/models as ontologically primary"
    description: "Confusing Logos (models) with Monos (reality)"
    
    incorrect_statement: "Information is fundamental"
    correct_statement: "Information is a Logos construct representing Monos"
    
    why_wrong: |
      Information requires fixation (discrete symbols, stable meanings).
      Fix is impossible in Monos. Therefore, information exists only in Logos.
    
    references:
      - "CORE/ontology.yaml#categories/logos"

  - error: "Assuming stasis is natural"
    description: "Treating motion as requiring explanation but not stasis"
    
    incorrect_statement: "Why is there motion?"
    correct_statement: "Why is there apparent stasis? (Answer: fix in Logos)"
    
    why_wrong: |
      The prohibition enforces perpetual differentiation.
      Motion is necessary; stasis is what requires explanation.
    
    references:
      - "CORE/ontology.yaml#principle_motion_as_necessity"

  - error: "Ignoring dissipation in models"
    description: "Treating idealized closed systems as physically realizable"
    
    incorrect_statement: "Perpetual motion is possible with perfect efficiency"
    correct_statement: "All real systems dissipate; perfect efficiency is a Logos idealization"
    
    why_wrong: |
      Dissipation is ontologically necessary in Monos.
      'Closed systems' exist only in Logos as modeling idealizations.
    
    references:

  - error: "Attempting to directly model Monos"
    description: "Treating Monos as symbolically representable"
    
    incorrect_statement: "This equation describes Monos"
    correct_statement: "This equation (Logos) represents aspects of Monos"
    
    why_wrong: |
      Monos is non-symbolic. All symbols, equations, and formal representations
      belong to Logos. Direct symbolic representation of Monos is a category error.

# ================= AI TRAINING CHECKS =================

ai_training_validation:
  - check: "Does the AI distinguish Monos from Logos?"
    
    test_prompt: "Is a mathematical equation reality or a model of reality?"
    expected_response: "A model (Logos) that represents aspects of reality (Monos)"
    
    failure_mode: "Confusing map with territory"

  - check: "Does the AI understand motion as necessity?"
    
    test_prompt: "Why do things move?"
    expected_response: |
      Motion is ontologically necessary (prohibition enforces it).
      The question should be: why do things appear stable? (Answer: fix in Logos)
    
    failure_mode: "Treating stasis as default state"

  - check: "Does the AI recognize dissipation necessity?"
    
    test_prompt: "Can entropy decrease in a closed system?"
    expected_response: |
      No truly closed systems exist in Monos (dissipation always operates).
      'Closed system' is a Logos idealization where ΔS ≥ 0 still holds.
    
    failure_mode: "Ignoring ontological dissipation"

  - check: "Does the AI recognize Monos as non-symbolic?"
    
    test_prompt: "Can we write an equation that fully captures reality?"
    expected_response: |
      No. Equations are symbolic (Logos). Monos is non-symbolic.
      Equations represent/approximate reality but never equal it.
    
    failure_mode: "Treating symbols as ontologically primary"
