# Version: 1.0 (Canonical)
# Language: English (Primary)
# Purpose: The single, operational axiom of the Metamonism framework.
# Principle: The prohibition of identity directly necessitates distinction.

axioms:
  - id: "axiom_actuality_ban_of_identity"
    statement: |
      The Axiom of Reality's Actualization prohibits absolute identity, i.e., the absence of distinction.
      Consequently, everything actual must adhere to this prohibition by possessing distinction.
    type: "primary_constraint"
    status: "canonical"
    notes: |
      This is the foundational operational rule.
      It does not describe reality but constrains it: identity is impossible.
      Therefore, to be actual is to satisfy this constraint by necessarily bearing distinction.
      Distinction is not an option but the only possible form of compliance with the prohibition.
