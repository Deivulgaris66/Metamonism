    This article establishes ALTERNATIVE gravitational paradigm:
    - NOT Newtonian attraction (force at distance)
    - NOT Einsteinian curvature (geometric spacetime)
    - BUT screening in dissipation ocean (processual dynamics)
    
    Eliminates dark matter (galactic rotation curves explained)
    Reinterprets black holes (perfect screens, not singularities)
    Provides ontological foundation for gravitational phenomena

# ABSTRACT
# =============================================================================
abstract: |
  From FORCES Article Section 6:
  "Gravity is not attraction but mutual SCREENING of masses in gravitational
  background created by universal corpuscle outward dissipation."
  
  MECHANISM:
  - All corpuscles (second generation) dissipate OUTWARD (ontological necessity)
  - Creates OCEAN of dissipation flow (gravitational background)
  - Masses SCREEN each other from this ocean
  - Result: Effective "push toward each other" (not pull)
  
  SCALING:
  - NOT 1/r² (Newton's law incorrect at galactic scales)
  - BUT ϕ-scaling (golden ratio φ = 1.618...)
  - Force ∝ φ at certain scales → explains flat rotation curves
  
  CONSEQUENCES:
  - Galactic rotation curves WITHOUT dark matter
  - Gravitational lensing WITHOUT spacetime curvature
  - Black holes as PERFECT SCREENS (not singularities)
  - Galaxy cluster dynamics from screening gradients
  
  This article eliminates need for:
  - Dark matter (screening explains observations)
  - Curved spacetime (geometric interpretation unnecessary)
  - Gravitational singularities (screening saturates, not infinite)

# NOTES
# =============================================================================
notes: |
  This article establishes ALTERNATIVE gravitational paradigm eliminating:
  - Dark matter (rotation curves from φ-scaling)
  - Curved spacetime (geometric interpretation unnecessary)
  - Singularities (screening saturates)
  
  Key insights:
  1. Gravity = mutual screening (NOT attraction or curvature)
  2. Dissipation ocean = gravitational background (universal process)
  3. φ-scaling at large scales (golden ratio, NOT 1/r²)
  4. Black holes = perfect screens (NOT singularities)
  5. Observational equivalence to GR (same predictions, different ontology)
  
  This completes force unification in Metamonism:
  - EM: diff ↔ fix oscillation (E ⊥ B)
  - Weak: discharge of excess diff
  - Strong: π-gap tension
  - Gravity: screening in dissipation ocean (φ-scaling)
  
  All forces from SAME ontological foundation (diff/diss/fix operators).
  
  Eliminates 95% of "dark universe" (dark matter + dark energy).
  Only baryons + correct physics needed.
