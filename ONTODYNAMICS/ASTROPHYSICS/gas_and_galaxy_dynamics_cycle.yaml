# ABSTRACT
# =============================================================================
abstract: |
  Complete closed cycle of gas and galaxy dynamics in large-scale structure:
  
  1. VOIDS: Fresh H generated (cold_nucleogenesis_in_voids.yaml)
  2. EXPULSION: Dissipation pressure pushes gas → filament edges
  3. EDGE GALAXIES: Receive gas → active star formation → GAIN MASS
  4. INFALL: Heavy galaxies → gravitational migration TO cluster centers
  5. CLUSTER CORES: Minimal gas → star formation QUENCHES → low diff environment
  6. BARYON DECAY: Old red galaxies → axis unlocking (supernovae_without_remnants.yaml)
  7. MASS LOSS: Galaxies LOSE mass → become lighter
  8. OUTWARD MIGRATION: Light galaxies → gravitational drift BACK to void edges
  9. CYCLE REPEATS
  
  This article establishes WHY supernovae without remnants occur specifically
  in OLD RED GALAXIES IN CLUSTER CORES: they are the natural endpoint of
  the gas-mass-migration cycle.
  
  All phases are OBSERVABLE with current instruments.

    - Star formation feedback (mass gain/loss)
    - Baryon decay (mass loss via axis unlocking)

# WHY THIS MAKES SUPERNOVAE ARTICLE OBVIOUS
# =============================================================================
contextual_necessity:
  before_this_article:
    question: "Why search for no-remnant SN in OLD RED ELLIPTICALS specifically?"
    
    answer_without_context: "Seems arbitrary (why not spirals? why not young ellipticals?)"
    
  after_this_article:
    answer_with_context: |
      Now it's SELF-EVIDENT:
      
      1. Voids generate fresh H (nucleogenesis)
      2. Gas expelled to filaments (dissipation pressure)
      3. Edge galaxies accrete gas, form stars, GAIN MASS
      4. Heavy galaxies FALL TO CLUSTER CORES (gravity)
      5. In cores: gas depleted, SF quenches, LOW DIFF ENVIRONMENT
      6. Old red ellipticals in cores = IDEAL CONDITIONS for axis unlocking:
         - Isolated WDs (no external diff)
         - Low diff environment (no interference)
         - Sufficient time (quenched for Gyr)
      7. Therefore: THESE galaxies specifically show baryon decay
      
      → Searching in old red core ellipticals is not arbitrary but
        NECESSARY consequence of the cycle dynamics.

      Article order:
      1. Eternal reality (foundation)
      2. Nucleogenesis (birth)
      3. Gas/galaxy cycle (THIS - dynamics)
      4. Supernovae without remnants (death - now obvious)
      
      This order makes each article's claims INEVITABLE given the previous.

# NOTES
# =============================================================================
notes: |
  This article establishes THE CONTEXT that makes supernovae_without_remnants.yaml
  predictions SELF-EVIDENT rather than arbitrary.
  
  Key insight: Baryon lifecycle naturally segregates into spatial zones:
  - Birth: Voids (cold nucleogenesis)
  - Youth: Filament edges (gas accretion, SF)
  - Maturity: Clusters (infall, quenching)
  - Death: Cluster cores (axis unlocking)
  
  Each phase has clear observational signatures.
  
  The CYCLE is closed:
  - Heavy galaxies fall inward (gain mass → sink)
  - Light galaxies drift outward (lose mass → rise)
  - Gas continuously flows void → filament
  - Steady state (never equilibrium, diff > fix)
  
  All testable with current facilities.
