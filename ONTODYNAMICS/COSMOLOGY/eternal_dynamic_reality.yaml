# ABSTRACT
# =============================================================================
abstract: |
  From the Ban of Absolute Identity axiom (CORE/axioms.yaml), we derive that
  reality CANNOT have a beginning (t=0 = absolute identity state) and CANNOT
  expand uniformly (metric expansion = forbidden symmetry).
  
  Reality is ETERNAL and DYNAMICALLY STABLE: it exists as perpetual non-equilibrium
  process where dissipation prevents both collapse (to identity) and equilibrium
  (frozen state).
  
  This necessitates CLOSED BARYON CYCLE: continuous birth (cold nucleosynthesis
  in voids) balances continuous death (axis unlocking in ellipticals).
  
  All standard cosmology predictions (Big Bang, expansion, primordial nucleosynthesis)
  are replaced by eternal dynamic cycle predictions.
  
  This is the FOUNDATIONAL prediction - all other ONTODYNAMICS articles derive
  from or support this framework.

# =============================================================================
# CENTRAL CLAIM
# =============================================================================
central_claim:
  statement: |
    Reality is ETERNAL (no beginning, no end) and DYNAMICALLY STABLE
    (perpetual non-equilibrium preventing both identity and equilibrium).
    
    Big Bang (t=0 singularity) and Space Expansion (metric growth) are
    ONTOLOGICALLY IMPOSSIBLE per Ban of Absolute Identity axiom.
  
  ontological_status: "Necessary consequence of axioms (not empirical hypothesis)"
  
  confidence: "ABSOLUTE - follows deductively from axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity"

# =============================================================================
# DERIVATION FROM AXIOMS
# =============================================================================
derivation:
  axiom_source: "CORE/axioms.yaml#axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity"
  
  axiom_statement: |
    "Absolute identity (a state without distinctions) is ontologically impossible.
    This prohibition actively enforces perpetual differentiation: reality cannot
    'stop' or 'freeze' without violating its own existence."
  
  logical_chain:
    
    step_1_no_beginning:
      claim: "Reality CANNOT have beginning (no t=0)"
      
      proof:
        premise_1: "Beginning requires state with t=0"
        premise_2: "At t=0: past = 0, future undefined, all properties indeterminate"
        premise_3: "State without determinate properties = absolute identity"
        premise_4: "Absolute identity is FORBIDDEN (axiom)"
        conclusion: "Therefore: t=0 cannot exist"
      
      implication: "Reality is ETERNAL (always existed, always will exist)"
      
      quote_from_axiom: |
        "Reality exists only as a process of differentiation.
        Motion is ontologically necessary; stasis requires explanation."
    
    step_2_no_end:
      claim: "Reality CANNOT end (no final state)"
      
      proof:
        premise_1: "Final state = cessation of all process"
        premise_2: "Cessation = perfect fixation (fix(x) = x permanently)"
        premise_3: "Perfect fixation = absolute identity"
        premise_4: "Absolute identity is FORBIDDEN (axiom)"
        conclusion: "Therefore: final state cannot exist"
      
      implication: "Reality is ETERNAL (no termination)"
    
    step_3_no_uniform_expansion:
      claim: "Space CANNOT expand uniformly (no metric expansion)"
      
      proof:
        premise_1: "Metric expansion = all points move apart uniformly"
        premise_2: "Uniform change = perfect symmetry (all points identical in behavior)"
        premise_3: "Perfect symmetry = lack of distinctions"
        premise_4: "Lack of distinctions = absolute identity"
        premise_5: "Absolute identity is FORBIDDEN (axiom)"
        conclusion: "Therefore: uniform metric expansion cannot exist"
      
      implication: "Space does NOT expand; observed redshift has different origin"
      
      note: |
        Local expansion/contraction is ALLOWED (breaks symmetry).
        Uniform global expansion is FORBIDDEN (perfect symmetry).
    
    step_4_no_equilibrium:
      claim: "Reality CANNOT reach equilibrium (no heat death)"
      
      proof:
        premise_1: "Equilibrium = state where all processes cease"
        premise_2: "All processes cease = perfect rest = fixation"
        premise_3: "Perfect fixation = absolute identity"
        premise_4: "Absolute identity is FORBIDDEN (axiom)"
        conclusion: "Therefore: equilibrium state cannot be reached"
      
      from_FORCES: "Theorem 7.4 (Impossibility of Equilibrium)"
      quote: |
        "Two dissipation directions compensate each other,
        but compensation can NEVER be complete.
        Reason: Fundamental asymmetry diff > fix."
      
      implication: "Reality is PERPETUAL NON-EQUILIBRIUM"
    
    step_5_dynamic_stability:
      claim: "Reality is DYNAMICALLY STABLE (not static, not chaotic)"
      
      mechanism: "Two-generation dissipation cycle (FORCES Article Section 7.7)"
      
      structure: |
        SPACE-TIME (1st generation)
          ↓ dissipates INWARD
        CORPUSCLES (2nd generation)
          ↓ dissipate OUTWARD
        SPACE-TIME (regenerated)
          ↓ cycle continues...
      
      stability_source: "Mutual compensation (never complete, always dynamic)"
      
      quote_from_FORCES: |
        "This creates a closed dynamic non-equilibrium cycle ensuring
        the stability of the manifest world without achieving equilibrium."
  
  conclusion: |
    From axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity, we NECESSARILY derive:
    1. Reality is ETERNAL (no t=0, no end)
    2. Space does NOT expand uniformly
    3. Equilibrium is UNREACHABLE
    4. Stability is DYNAMIC (via dissipation cycle)

# =============================================================================
# IMPOSSIBILITIES (What CANNOT exist)
# =============================================================================
impossibilities:
  
  big_bang_singularity:
    standard_claim: "Universe began at t=0 from singularity (infinite density, zero volume)"
    
    why_impossible:
      reason_1_t_equals_zero:
        violation: "t=0 = state without temporal distinctions"
        axiom_violated: "ban_of_absolute_identity"
        explanation: |
          At t=0:
          - No past (nothing to differ from)
          - No determinate future (pure potentiality)
          - All properties undefined (ρ→∞, V→0, T→∞ simultaneously)
          - This is ABSOLUTE IDENTITY state (no distinctions)
      
      reason_2_singularity_properties:
        violation: "Singularity = point where all properties become identical (undefined)"
        explanation: |
          Singularity means:
          - All spatial distinctions collapse (∀x,y: x = y)
          - All temporal distinctions collapse (past = present = future)
          - All physical properties indeterminate (cannot differ)
          - This is LITERAL absolute identity
      
      reason_3_causality:
        violation: "Singularity breaks causality (effect without cause)"
        explanation: |
          "Why did Big Bang happen at t=0 and not 'before'?"
          → No answer (causality undefined at singularity)
          → Uncaused event = violation of CMI structure (Conflict→Momentum→Force)
    
    metamonist_alternative: "Reality is eternal; observable phenomena have LOCAL explanations"
  
  metric_expansion:
    standard_claim: "Space itself expands uniformly (Hubble flow)"
    
    why_impossible:
      reason_1_perfect_symmetry:
        violation: "Uniform expansion = all points identical in behavior"
        axiom_violated: "diff > fix (differentiation must exceed fixation)"
        explanation: |
          Metric expansion means:
          ∀ points p₁, p₂: velocity v ∝ distance d
          → All points recede identically (perfect symmetry)
          → No distinctions between points (all behave same)
          → Violates diff > fix (requires perpetual differentiation)
      
      reason_2_space_as_substance:
        violation: "Treats space as entity that can 'grow'"
        explanation: |
          From FORCES Article Section 2.3:
          "Space is not empty container but geometry of Verb maneuvers—
          structure arising from tension between Monos and limit of fixation."
          
          Space = GEOMETRY (relational), not SUBSTANCE (entity)
          Geometry cannot 'expand' uniformly without reference frame
      
      reason_3_conservation:
        violation: "Expansion creates energy from nothing"
        explanation: |
          Expanding space → increasing volume
          → Dark energy density constant (ρ_Λ constant)
          → Total dark energy increases (E = ρ_Λ × V)
          → Energy not conserved (violates CMI momentum conservation)
    
    metamonist_alternative: "Redshift from photon energy loss in dissipation ocean (NOT Doppler)"
  
  heat_death_equilibrium:
    standard_claim: "Universe will reach maximum entropy equilibrium (heat death)"
    
    why_impossible:
      reason: "Equilibrium = cessation of all process = absolute identity"
      
      from_principle: "principle_ontological_dissipation"
      quote: |
        "Dissipation is the energy cost of maintaining momentum against resistance.
        Without dissipation, the prohibition would be violated."
      
      explanation: |
        Heat death requires:
        - All processes stop (no differentiation)
        - Maximum entropy reached (S_max)
        - No further change possible (dS/dt = 0)
        
        But axiom requires:
        - Perpetual differentiation (diff always active)
        - Dissipation never ceases (ontological necessity)
        - Process cannot stop (motion is necessary)
        
        Therefore: S → S_max is ASYMPTOTE (approached, never reached)

# NOTES
# =============================================================================
notes: |
  This is the FOUNDATIONAL cosmology article for ONTODYNAMICS.
  
  All other cosmology predictions (cold nucleosynthesis, redshift mechanisms,
  CMB origin, etc.) DERIVE FROM or SUPPORT this central framework.
  
  Key methodological point:
  - Big Bang impossibility is DEDUCTIVE (from axioms)
  - Specific mechanisms (redshift, CMB) are EMPIRICAL questions
  - Framework predicts THAT phenomena occur, not always HOW
  
  This article establishes:
  1. What is impossible (Big Bang, expansion, equilibrium)
  2. What is necessary (eternal cycle, baryon birth/death)
  3. What needs explanation (redshift, CMB, 13.8 Gyr)
  4. Where to look for evidence (voids, ellipticals)
  
  All ONTODYNAMICS/COSMOLOGY/ articles should reference this as foundation.
