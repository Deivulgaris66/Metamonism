# Ontodynamics: The Unfolding of Worlds

## Purpose

The ONTODYNAMICS directory is the predictive and applied layer of the Wayward Metamonism framework.

While CORE defines the immutable ontological axioms, ONTODYNAMICS specifies how those axioms unfold into concrete physical domains (“Worlds”).

It contains machine-readable (M) models describing observable regimes of reality as direct consequences of CORE principles.

These are not independent theories.

They are operational specifications of how the core ontology manifests across disciplines.

---

## Conceptual Position

Wayward Metamonism treats reality as a self-regulating dissipation process.

From this follow:

- nodes as localizers of dissipation  
- mass as topological closure  
- gravity as screening of flow  
- photons as transport modes of dissipation  
- matter as stabilized localization  
- cosmology as distribution of dissipation demand  

CORE answers **what reality is**.  
ONTODYNAMICS answers **what this implies physically**.

## Structure

Each subdirectory represents a distinct “World” (discipline).

Each World contains:

- `manifest.yaml` — scope, dependencies, and inter-world relations  
- domain model files (`*.yaml`) — minimal ontodynamic specifications  

Current structure:

### PHYSICS/

Models for physical phenomena.

- `manifest.yaml` — overview and links  
- `quantum_mechanics.yaml` — ontological interpretation of quantum states and measurement  
- `thermodynamics.yaml` — entropy and arrow of time  
- revised ontological interpretation of quantum mechanics

---

### COSMOLOGY/

Models for cosmological structure and evolution.

- `manifest.yaml` — overview and connections  
- `redshift.yaml` — redshift as dissipation, not metric expansion  
- `large_scale.yaml` — formation of cosmic structure  
- `cold_nucleogenesis_in_voids.yaml` — continuous baryonic matter formation in voids  

The cosmological cold nucleogenesis model is formally developed in:

---

### ASTROPHYSICS/

Astrophysical consequences of dissipation localization.

- `gravity_as_screening.yaml` — gravitation modeled as screening of global flow by node density gradients

Acceleration emerges from differential under-localization, not attractive force.

---

### PARTICLE_PHYSICS/

Processual particle models.

- `photon_complete_cosmology.yaml` — photons treated as dissipation transport modes integrated into global cosmology

Redshift arises from dissipation, not expansion.

---

### CHEMISTRY/

Models for chemical phenomena.

- `manifest.yaml` — overview and connections  
- `bonding.yaml` — chemical bonding as localized dissipation coupling

---

## Guiding Principle

Every model in this directory must:

- be a logical derivation from CORE axioms (primarily the Indifference Ban)  
- use the core operators (`diff`, `fix`) as foundational language  
- remain minimal and falsifiable  

These are not phenomenological fits.

They are unfoldings of the same ontology into different observational regimes.

---

## Workflow & Versioning

- **Iterative Development**  
  Individual YAML files are versioned independently (v0.1, v0.2, …).

- **Core Dependency**  
  Each `manifest.yaml` explicitly declares dependency on a CORE version.

- **Inter-World Links**  
  Relations sections define isomorphisms and dependencies between Worlds, forming a coherent cross-disciplinary network.

---

## How to Navigate

1. Start with `manifest.yaml` inside a World.  
2. Examine individual model files (`*.yaml`).  
3. Refer back to CORE for axioms and operators.

Understanding always flows:

CORE → ONTODYNAMICS → Observables.

## Research Program

ONTODYNAMICS constitutes an active predictive framework.

Cold nucleogenesis in voids is the first externally published result.

Further layers under development include:

- galactic circulation between filaments and voids  
- baryonic transport cycles  
- black hole growth as dissipation sinks  
- cosmological structure without expansion  

The framework is cumulative.

---

## Summary

Reality is not composed of objects.

It is regulated through dissipation.

Nodes localize flow.  
Voids lack nodes.  
Matter forms where dissipation is insufficient.

ONTODYNAMICS documents how this unfolds across physical scales.
