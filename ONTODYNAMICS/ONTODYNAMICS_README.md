# ONTODYNAMICS: The Unfolding of Worlds

## Purpose

ONTODYNAMICS is the predictive and applied layer of the Wayward Metamonism framework.

While CORE defines immutable ontological axioms, ONTODYNAMICS specifies how those axioms unfold into concrete physical domains (“Worlds”).

It contains machine-readable (M) models describing observable regimes of reality as direct consequences of CORE principles.

These are not independent theories.

They are operational specifications of how a single processual ontology manifests across disciplines.

ONTODYNAMICS exists to produce falsifiable structure.

## Conceptual Position

Wayward Metamonism treats reality as a self-regulating dissipation process generated by the prohibition of absolute identity.

Existence begins as unresolved conflict.

That conflict cannot be eliminated.
It can only be redistributed.

This redistribution into new degrees of freedom is called **dissipation**.

Dissipation is not loss.
It is conflict migration.

Its minimal channel is **orthogonality**.

Every new degree of freedom emerges orthogonally to the previous one until metric expansion is exhausted, after which dissipation proceeds quantitatively via multiplicity of localization nodes.

This logic is formally developed in:

Myshko, A. (2026).  
*Orthogonal Dissipation: Logical Unfolding of Reality and Physical Modes of a Single Process.*  
Zenodo.  
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18678280

From this follow:

- dissipation as redistribution of ontological tension  
- orthogonality as minimal continuation mechanism  
- metric unfolding: 0D → 1D → 2D → 3D  
- 4D as global centripetal dissipation flow  
- transition to quantitative dissipation (node multiplicity)  
- mass as unfinished dissipation  
- forces as dissipation modes  
- gravity as shadow mode of global dissipation  
- orbits as compensation zones between global and local flows  
- matter as stabilized localization  
- cosmology as distribution of dissipation demand  

CORE answers **what reality is**.  
ONTODYNAMICS answers **what this implies physically**.

All models implement the transition from metric differentiation (`diff`) to quantitative dissipation (`diss`) as the fundamental mechanism of structure formation.

## Structure

Each subdirectory represents a distinct “World” (discipline).

Each World contains:

- `manifest.yaml` — scope, dependencies, and inter-world relations  
- domain model files (`*.yaml`) — minimal ontodynamic specifications  

Current structure:

---

### PHYSICS/

Models for physical phenomena.

- `manifest.yaml` — overview and links  
- `quantum_mechanics.yaml` — ontological interpretation of quantum states and measurement  
- `thermodynamics.yaml` — entropy and arrow of time  
- `orthogonal_dissipation.yaml` — canonical physical generator

These models derive conservation laws, decoherence, thermodynamic irreversibility, force modalities, and orbital stability directly from dissipation enforcement.

---

### COSMOLOGY/

Models for cosmological structure and evolution.

- `manifest.yaml` — overview and connections  
- `redshift.yaml` — redshift as dissipation, not metric expansion  
- `large_scale.yaml` — formation of cosmic structure  
- `cold_nucleogenesis_in_voids.yaml` — continuous baryonic matter formation in voids  

These models implement orthogonal dissipation and the metric → quantitative transition (diff/diss) as the physical basis of cosmological structure.

Cold nucleogenesis is formally developed in:

Myshko, A. (2026).  
*Preliminaries of Cold Nucleogenesis: A Wayward Metamonism Processual Model of Continuous Matter Birth.*  
Zenodo.  
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18667327

This is the first externally published observational consequence of ONTODYNAMICS.

---

### ASTROPHYSICS/

Astrophysical consequences of dissipation localization.

- `gravity_as_screening.yaml` — gravitation modeled as shadowing of global dissipation by local flows  

Gravity is not attraction.

It is local deficit of global dissipation between mutually screening local dissipative sources.

Casimir effect provides direct laboratory demonstration of this mechanism.

---

### PARTICLE_PHYSICS/

Processual particle models.

- `photon_complete_cosmology.yaml` — photons treated as dissipation transport modes integrated into global cosmology  

Redshift arises from dissipation, not expansion.

Particles are stabilized dissipation configurations.

---

### CHEMISTRY/

Models for chemical phenomena.

- `manifest.yaml` — overview and connections  
- `bonding.yaml` — chemical bonding as localized dissipation coupling  

---

## Guiding Principle

Every model in this directory must:

- be a logical derivation from CORE axioms (primarily the Indifference Ban)  
- use the core operators (`diff`, `diss`, `fix`) as foundational language  
- remain minimal and falsifiable  

These are not phenomenological fits.

They are unfoldings of the same ontological engine into different observational regimes.

---

## Workflow & Versioning

- **Iterative Development**  
  Individual YAML files are versioned independently (v0.1, v0.2, …).

- **Core Dependency**  
  Each `manifest.yaml` explicitly declares dependency on a CORE version.

- **Inter-World Links**  
  Relations sections define isomorphisms and dependencies between Worlds, forming a coherent cross-disciplinary network.

---

## How to Navigate

1. Start with `manifest.yaml` inside a World.  
2. Examine individual model files (`*.yaml`).  
3. Refer back to CORE for axioms and operators.

Understanding always flows:

CORE → ONTODYNAMICS → Observables.

---

## Research Program

ONTODYNAMICS constitutes an active predictive framework.

Orthogonal Dissipation provides the physical generator.

Cold nucleogenesis is the first published observational result.

Further layers under development include:

- galactic circulation between filaments and voids  
- baryonic transport cycles  
- black hole growth as dissipation sinks  
- cosmological structure without expansion  

The framework is cumulative.

Each new World extends the same dissipation engine.

## Summary

Reality is not composed of objects.

It is regulated through dissipation.

Conflict cannot stop.  
It can only unfold.

Orthogonality opens degrees of freedom.  
Mass is unfinished dissipation.  
Forces are dissipation modes.  
Gravity is a shadow.  
Orbits are compensation zones.

ONTODYNAMICS documents how this unfolds across physical scales — with explicit falsification criteria.
