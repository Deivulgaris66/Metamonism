    This article REINTERPRETS ALL cosmological observations through
    correct photon physics:
    - Redshift ≠ Doppler (space expansion) BUT photon aging (dissipation)
    - CMB ≠ Big Bang echo BUT photon graveyard (end-of-life radiation)
    - Lensing ≠ spacetime curvature BUT standard gravity on locked axes
    
    Standard cosmology built on INCORRECT photon interpretation.
    This article provides CORRECT foundation.

# ABSTRACT
# =============================================================================
abstract: |
  The photon is a baryon with ONE AXIS UNLOCKED (two locked, one open).
  
  STRUCTURE:
  - Two locked axes (x, y): Form 2D plane with cyclic Monos motion
    → Have mass/energy, electromagnetism, participate in gravity
  - One open axis (z): NO intrinsic spacetime along this axis
    → Photon rides ACTUALIZATION FRONT of reality
    → Speed c = speed of Monos actualization (NOT photon property)
  
  DISSIPATION (ontological necessity):
  - Monos in locked axes MUST dissipate
  - Energy decreases over time
  - Centripetal/centrifugal balance changes
  - One cycle takes MORE time → photon grows larger
  - Frequency DROPS → wavelength INCREASES
  
  → This IS redshift (photon aging, NOT Doppler/expansion)
  
  END OF LIFE:
  - Energy → 0
  - Frequency → microwave (GHz)
  - Wavelength → millimeters
  - Photons accumulate at this equilibrium state
  
  → This IS CMB (photon graveyard, NOT Big Bang echo)
  
  GRAVITATIONAL EFFECTS:
  - Locked axes have mass → participate in gravity
  - Lensing = standard gravitational deflection (NOT spacetime curvature)
  - Dense packets (SN, GRB): photon-photon gravity → packet size changes
  
  ALL standard cosmological observations REINTERPRETED through correct
  photon physics. Big Bang, expansion, spacetime curvature UNNECESSARY.

      orthogonality: "E ⊥ B (fundamental from diff ⊥ fix)"
      
      from_FORCES: |
        Section 4.3 - Electromagnetism:
        "E-field = moment of diff (opening)
         B-field = moment of fix (closure)
         They generate each other (oscillate)"
    
    mass_energy:
      rest_mass: "m = 0 (open axis → no confinement)"
      
      BUT_energy_present: "E = hν (in locked axes)"
      
      energy_source: "Monos cyclic motion in x, y axes"
      
      relation: "E = hν where h = Planck constant (quantization)"
      
      critical_point: |
        Locked axes HAVE mass/energy content (hν)
        This energy PARTICIPATES in gravity
        (See gravitational_lensing section)
    
    gravitational_participation:
      locked_axes_have: "Energy E = hν → equivalent mass m = E/c²"
      
      therefore: "Photon DOES interact gravitationally"
      
      interactions:
        with_matter: "Deflection by massive objects (lensing)"
        with_photons: "Self-gravity in dense packets (SN, GRB)"
        
      clarification: |
        Standard view: "Photon massless, doesn't gravitate"
        Correct view: "Locked axes have energy → gravitate normally"
  
  # ========== OPEN AXIS (z) - Propagation Direction ==========
  open_axis_properties:

        motion: "Carried by actualization (not self-propelled)"
        speed: "c (same as actualization rate)"
        
    why_c_is_constant:
      NOT_photon_property: "c is NOT 'speed photon travels'"
      
      BUT_reality_property: "c = speed Monos actualizes reality"
      
      therefore:
        - "c same for all photons (regardless of energy)"
        - "c same in all reference frames (actualization rate invariant)"
        - "c maximum speed (cannot exceed actualization)"
        
      from_relativity: |
        Special relativity CORRECT in observations
        BUT interpretation WRONG:
        - Observations: Lorentz transforms, c invariant (YES)
        - Interpretation: "spacetime fabric" (NO)
        - Correct: Actualization front dynamics
    
    why_m_equals_zero:
      reason: "Open axis → no confinement along z"
      
      mass_requires: "Closure (fix) along axis"
      
      photon_z_axis: "Open → no closure → m = 0"

# NOTES
# =============================================================================
notes: |
  This article REINTERPRETS ALL major cosmological observations through
  correct photon physics.
  
  Key insights:
  1. Photon structure (2 locked + 1 open) explains all properties
  2. c = actualization rate (not photon speed) → resolves relativity ontology
  3. Dissipation inevitable → photon aging → redshift WITHOUT expansion
  4. End-of-life accumulation → CMB WITHOUT Big Bang
  5. Locked axes gravity → lensing WITHOUT spacetime curvature
  6. Self-gravity in packets → SN evolution WITHOUT time dilation
  
  Standard cosmology built on INCORRECT photon interpretation:
  - Assumes photon massless → ignores locked axis energy
  - Assumes photon non-dissipating → violates ontological necessity
  - Assumes spacetime entity → unnecessary ontological commitment
  
  Metamonist photon physics:
  - Ontologically grounded (derives from axioms)
  - Observationally equivalent (matches data)
  - Philosophically superior (clearer ontology)
  
  This is FOUNDATION for cosmology without Big Bang, expansion, or
  spacetime curvature. All observations explained via photon properties.
