This article formalizes dissipation as the primary ontodynamic mechanism
arising from the prohibition of absolute identity.

Core results:

- Dissipation as redistribution of conflict into new degrees of freedom
- Orthogonality as minimal dissipation channel
- Metric unfolding: 0D → 1D → 2D → 3D
- 4D as global centripetal flow
- Transition to quantitative dissipation (node multiplicity)
- Mass as unfinished dissipation
- Forces as dissipation modes
- Gravity as shadow mode of global dissipation
- Casimir effect as direct demonstration
- Orbits as compensation zones between global and local flows

This article provides ontological foundation for:

- cold nucleogenesis
- gravity_as_screening
- photon_complete_cosmology
- gas migration models
