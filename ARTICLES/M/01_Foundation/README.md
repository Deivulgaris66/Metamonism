# Article 1: Machine Specification (M-version)

**Status:** Draft | **Author:** Andrii Myshko (Metamonist)
**Corresponds to H-version:** [`../H/01_Foundation/`](../H/01_Foundation/)

## Purpose
This is the **machine-readable, structured elaboration** of the claims and arguments presented in the human-readable article "Metamonism as the Foundation of All Sciences".

## Structure
*   `specification.yaml`: Contains the formal breakdown of the article's core propositions.
*   `references.yaml`: Contains explicit, verifiable links to elements in `CORE/` and `ONTODYNAMICS/` that this article defines, uses, or extends.

## Direct Links to Foundation
This M-version **defines** the following core elements (see `references.yaml`):
1.  The **Indifference Ban Axiom** (`CORE/axioms.yaml`).
2.  The primary definitions of **Monas** and **Logos** (`CORE/definitions.yaml`).

## Next Steps
This specification will be populated and refined in parallel with the finalization of the H-version article.
