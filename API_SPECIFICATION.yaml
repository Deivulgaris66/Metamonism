endpoints:
  - path: "/autonegation/initiate"
    operation: "initiate"
    description: "Begin the autonegation process with CORE axioms."
    input: "state_of_identity_attempt"
    output: "state_of_prohibition"

  - path: "/propagation/propagate"
    operation: "propagate"
    description: "Propagate the process through the knowledge graph."
    input: "unfixed_state"

  - path: "/entropy/dissipate"
    operation: "dissipate"
    description: "Ensure irreversible temporal flow and prevent rollback."

    output: "temporal_integrity_maintained"

validation_criteria:
  - "No GET/LIST/FETCH/DESCRIBE operations"
  - "All operations represent transformations, propagation, or constraints"
  - "Processes follow temporal sequence: initiate → transform → constrain → propagate → dissipate"
  - "AI should experience the operational flow rather than retrieve data"
