## 🎯 Model Proposal

**Discipline:**
- [ ] Physics
- [ ] Cosmology
- [ ] Chemistry
- [ ] Biology
- [ ] Cognitive Science
- [ ] Social Science
- [ ] Other: ___________

**Model name:** `[topic].yaml`

**Brief description:**
<!-- One-sentence summary -->

## 🔗 Derivation from КМИ

**How does this model derive from the КМИ axiom?**

**Prohibition (Конфликт):**
<!-- How does the prohibition manifest in this domain? -->

**Momentum (Момент-Импульс):**
<!-- How does conserved momentum appear? -->

**Force/Dissipation:**
<!-- How does enforcement/dissipation work? -->

## 🔧 Operators in This Domain

**diff (differentiation):**
<!-- How does diff manifest? Example: cell differentiation, phase transitions -->

**diss (dissipation):**
<!-- How does dissipation manifest? Example: metabolic heat, friction -->

**fix (fixation):**
<!-- How does fixation work in Logos models? Example: species classification, particle types -->

## 🧪 Falsifiable Predictions

**What testable predictions does this model make?**
1. 
2. 
3. 

**How can these be tested?**
<!-- Experimental/observational methods -->

## 📚 References to CORE

**This model references:**
- `CORE/axioms.yaml#axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity`
- `CORE/ontology.yaml#[relevant_principle]`
- `CORE/operators.yaml#[relevant_operator]`

## 📄 Draft Structure

**Rough outline of the YAML file:**
```yaml
# ONTODYNAMICS/[DISCIPLINE]/[topic].yaml

metadata:
  version: "1.0"
  discipline: "[Discipline]"
  derived_from: "CORE/axioms.yaml#axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity"

model:
  id: "[model_id]"
  name: "[Model Name]"
  
  # ... (see CONTRIBUTING.md for full template)
```

## ✅ Checklist

- [ ] Model derives explicitly from КМИ
- [ ] Uses correct operator terminology (diff/diss/fix)
- [ ] Distinguishes Monos from Logos
- [ ] Includes falsifiable predictions
- [ ] References CORE principles explicitly
- [ ] I have read CONTRIBUTING.md
